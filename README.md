# Tennis Serves Aggressiveness and Player Clustering Evaluation
This is an evaluation of wheter tennis players are not being aggressive enough on their serves. I look at both  the win rates for different types of serves and the correlation of double faults to aggressiveness.
I also introduce a method of clustering tennis players by playstyle that is based on natural language processing methodology. 

matchchartingstats.ipynb is the main analysis for the comparison of first and second serve, focusing on the likelihood of winning the point at the time of serve. 
PointChartingStats.ipynb attempts to answer why some players are seemingly overly cautious on the second serve, focusing on the mental effects of double faults in the following points.
PlayerClustering attempts to cluster players by patterns of their shot selection, using methods often used for sentence structure evaluation.
